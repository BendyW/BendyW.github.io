        <p>A project with the goal of making it easier to see events. Uses MeetUp's API. Also uses GoogleMaps API to map out MeetUP events. The front and back end take work on ExpressJS. Server made using MySql. Done before having an experience in AngularJS or ReactJS. Will be reworked in the future using angular.</p>

        </a>
        <p>A game meant to be played with friends. Create a user, join a team, and join an event as a team. Bar crawl through the city while completing challenges to score points. Maps a route on GoogleMaps filled with challenges to complete. If I have time I will add the ability to upload images, and possibly a way for users to create challenges.</p>
